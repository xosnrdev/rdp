# TODO

## Tokenizer

- [ ] Define token types (e.g., identifiers, literals, operators, delimiters) and their regular expressions.
- [ ] Implement the tokenizer to convert source code into tokens, handling whitespace and comments.
- [ ] Write tests to verify the tokenizer's functionality.

## Grammar and Parsing

- [ ] Analyze the grammar and fix any left-recursive rules.
- [ ] Design the top-down parser and implement parsing functions.
- [ ] Add lookahead for predictive parsing and implement error handling.

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- [ ] Design AST node structures and implement the AST builder.
- [ ] Create tests to ensure the AST represents the source code correctly.

## Parser Integration

- [ ] Integrate the tokenizer and parser.
- [ ] Support complex features like functions and control flow.
- [ ] Optimize the parser for performance.
