# TODO

- [ ] **Implement Comment Handling**

  - Update grammar rules to allow comments in source code
  - Support single-line comments using `//`
  - Optionally add multi-line comment support with `/* ... */`
  - Ensure comments are skipped during tokenization and don't affect parsing

- [ ] **Add Integration Tests**

  - Create a test suite for the parser using sample `.pfl` files
  - Verify that the parser produces correct ASTs for various language constructs
  - Include tests for edge cases and error handling scenarios

- [ ] **Update DX**
  - Update the README we the new features and improvements
  - Final cleanup and call it a day
