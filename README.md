> Recursive Descent Parser for a Programming Language.

## Proof of Concept

This project serves as a proof of concept for a **Recursive Descent Parser** implemented in Rust. The goal is to deepen my understanding of parsing techniques and language design by systematically building a parser from scratch.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Implement a manual Recursive Descent Parser for a programming language characterized by a letter-based syntax.
- **Approach**: Follow a structured methodology to implement parsing techniques.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gain insights into language design and parsing strategies.
